## Blockchain

Blockchain is a fundamentallly software protocols that allows you operate under shared assuptions without trusting each other.

These data can be anything.

[Blockchain is technology](http://www.placeholder.com)

## Hashing

Hash is cryption.

e.g. SHA-256 (Secure Hashing Algorithm)<https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html>

1. Hashing is a one-way function.

>_Bitcoin uses SHA-256_
>_Ethereum uses Keccak-256_

2. Hashing is unique.
3. Is Hashing another way to full security, just like the function of quantum information?
4. It's called "chechsum" when the transmittion of information is achieved.


## How do proof of work blockchains work?

What do miners do?

- Miners are computing powers that secures the blockchain by adding a special number to the verified transactions on the blockchain.
- The special numbers are called "nonce", abbreviation of "numbers only once", which a series of additional numbers that make the transaction hashing output begins with "0"s.

Impact of mining

- Well, mining requires enourmous amount of computing power that renders corruption of a blockchain infeasible for a single person, or even for a nation state.
- On the other hand, the power uses so much fuel, lots of which are fossil-fuel based, that is going to impact the environment unprecedentedly.

Questions

- Why do miners have to pack transactions to a special hashing series? Simplicity
