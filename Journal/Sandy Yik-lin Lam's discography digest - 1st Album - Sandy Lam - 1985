*If hope had a color, it will be the pale green of a newly sprouted seed.*

A Washington Post editorial published on Earth Day[^1].

I like that sentence not only for the explicit picture it painted, also because it's true. Hope is a bud, a minute bump, biologically speaking, layers of cells. But by adding up the living units with the right infrastructure and the ability of mitosis, buds can penetrate soil.

With that said, the 1966-Hong Kong-born singer Sandy Lam was exactly the bud of a singing prodigy when her first and namesake album[^2] came out, both metaphorically and promotionally.

Her album cover was so far from subtlety. Who can find a more 19-year-old looking 19-year-old girl? Hairstyle that shaped like a pineapple, buck teeth that stick out and a sunshine smile, a typical teenager image in Eastern-Asian culture where a little flaws of appearences is often adored.

The tracking list didn't try to escape the stereotype, either, but attempted to make it appealing. Take a look at the tracking list[^2]

    1. I Don't Know About Love (愛情I Don't Know)
    2. First Date (第一次約會)
    3. Girlie Feelings (少女的心)
    4. Summer's Umbrella (太陽傘下)
    5. Please Do Not Leave (不想你走)
    6. Beautiful Moment (美的片刻)
    7. Love Vehicle (高速愛情車)
    8. Troubled Teenagers (苦難中的少年)
    9. Red Lips (搖擺口紅)
    10. Quiet Date (無聲約會)

Looking back 37 years later, it is obvious that the debut was more a water testing piece than a representative work. CBS Sony Record gave the young lady a coming-of-age persona with characteristics such as being clueless of love, being nervous and excited on a first date and being infatuated with imagination of beauty. It's fair to say it was cliché, but you can't say it didn't do a good job. Don't forget she *was* 19 years old. More importantly, the music and the lyrics did brought a bright feeling about a heart of teenaging girl.

On vocal, it does feel eerie to witness a legend's starting age... and find out she was no close to the Sandy Lam who were capable of blending skill and sincerity without a trace. Here she showcased her spotless tone in nearly every song with occasional raspy sound, which would be more than tolerable on others but surprising on Sandy Lam.

For the sake of sincerity, I put First Date into my favourite.

The next album was still largely influenced by Japanese Idol Craze, but came with transformational focus.
