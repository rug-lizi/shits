Volitality, soul-searching and naivity. Sandy Lam's second album surprises could've shaken its fan base, it varied so much from her debut. Self-indulgence gave Sandy a rebellious young woman persona, in spite of her sweet girl with dream for love charactor just 11 months ago. But the musical deviation cannot be criticized as reckless. Far from it, this album was a such a success that it hit platimun(500,000) sales mark 3 months after its release.

Looking back at its tracking list[^1] 

    1. Anger (放縱)
    2. Cupid's Holiday (愛神 Holiday)
    3. Am I your love tomorrow? (明天是否愛我)
    4. Save me, quick! (快快救我)
    5. Kiss (偷吻)
    6. Heartbreak Alley (心碎巷)
    7. Crazy for me (為我心痴)
    8. Corner of the street (長街的一角)
    9. I am yours already (但我已給你)
    10. Heart adventure (心裡探險)

The lead title tested popular among Hong Kong youth. The song was about a girl's regret from her self-destructive behaviour after getting hurt by love. With its strong percusssive rythm, heavily emotional tone and expressive lyrics with catchy phrases, `Anger` became her first hit song. The last line, `I am empty, I am lonely, I am freezing`, created a craze in HK's pop culture.

Sandy Lam's vocal technique was near-flawless comparing to her first album, albeit her 20 year old age. She started showing talent in emotional expressive songs. The perfection that was appreciated by the greater Chinese area can be traced to this record.

I can't get the title song out of my head. Cupid's holiday and Heartbreak alley were also memorable.
