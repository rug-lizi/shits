# DeFi History Week 1 

## Can money have intangible value?

Of course it can. 

## Examples

- the tale of Iraqi Swiss Dinar and Saddam Dinar. 
- the stone currency

## the Point

The point is value comes from its usage, not from what backs it. i.e. A currency can have nothing behind, but as long as it's used de facto, it's valued.

## CeFi history

## Problems of CeFi

- Centralised control

## DeFi History

## Proof of Work ideas

- Proof of work
- Timestamps of documents
- Completely transparent and very very fast

## Bitcoin

- The Paper: Oct. 31 2008
- Bitcoin solve the double spend problem
- Everything of a bitcoin can be traced on the blockchain, and can be done very very fast. 

## Meaning of Bitcoin
- You know your counterpart's bitcoin before the transaction happens
- Immutablity, of course. The record of the blockchain cannot be changed
- Notes realises all this
- Portability, you can send and receive anywhere anytime, without centralised bank regulation and slowing down

## Ethereum
Ethereum does one thing Bitcoin can't do, it allows you to run a small computer program on the currency that's called a "smart contract". 

Okay, so essentially with Bitcoin you can interact with other, let's say, accounts other people or institutions with transfers. But in ethereum you can actually interact with a smart contract, so that's really special. 

## dApps

dApps = Decentralized Applications

DeFi is fundamentally a marketplace for dApps that function as financial primitives, such as exchange, lend, tokenize, etc.
