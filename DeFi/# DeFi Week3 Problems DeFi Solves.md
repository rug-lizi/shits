## Inefficiency

Volume and frictions

- The volume can be an organization burden
  
No organizational overhead

- no middle people
- smart contracts take the main role in near-zero organizational overhead

Keepers

- External participants who provide services to DeFi protocols
- To ensure that a dApp's benefits and services are optimally priced, keeper rewards are often structured as an auction, as are the gas fee
- Value comes from the guarantee that users pay the market price for the services they need, rather than a price that the central bank controll

Fork

- open source code
- DeFi is brought up from the open source spirit

dApps forkable

- Not only is the code of the entire Ethereum blockchain public and forkable, but each DeFi dApp built on top of Ethereum is as well

Vampirism

- Vamparism is an exact or near-exact copy of a DeFi platform designed to poach liquidity or users by offering larger incentives than the platform it is copying
- The larger incentives usually take the form of inflationary rewards offered at a far higher rate than the original platform offers
- Users might be attracted to the higher potential reward for the same functionality, which would cause a reduction in usage and liquidity on the initial platform

Vampirism risks

- If the inflationary rewards are flawed, over long-term use the clone could perhaps collapse after a large asset bubble
- The clones could also select closer to optimal models and replace the original platform
- Vampirism is not an inherent risk or flaw, but rather a complicating factor arising from the pure competition and openness of DeFi
- The selection process will eventually give rise to more robust financial infrastructure with optimal efficiency

## Limited Access

DeFi and financial democracy

- The unbanked, small businesses
- The result impact on the entire global economy *should* be positive
- In traditional finance, the financial products with the most competitive pricing and most favorable term are restricted to large institutions
- DeFi allows any users access to the entirety of its financial infrastructure

Yield farming

- Yield farming provides inflationary or contract-funded rewards to users for
staking capital or utilizing a protocol
- Any user can participate
- Yield farming is particularly powerful in the case of governance tokens
- A user of a protocol that issues a governance token via yield farming
becomes a partial owner of the platform through the issued token
- A rare occurrence in traditional finance, this process is a common way to
give ownership of the platform to the people who use and benefit from it.

Initial DeFi offering

- An interesting consequence of yield farming is that a user can create an
Initial DeFi Offering(IDO) by market making his own Uniswap trading pair
(discussed later).
- Suppose the userâ€™s token is called DFT and has a total supply of 2 million.
- The user can make each DFT worth 0.10 USDC by opening the market with
1 million DFT and 100,000 USDC.
- Any ERC-20 token holder can purchase DFT, which drives up the price. As
the only liquidity provider, the user also receives all of the trading fees.

## Opacity

Smart contracts are transparent

- DeFi elegantly solves the transparency problem through the open and contractual nature of agreements
- Realistically, the average consumer does not understand the contract code,
but can rely on the open-source nature of the platform and the wisdom of
the crowd to feel secure.
- Overall, DeFi mitigates counterparty risk and thus creates a host of
efficiencies not present under traditional finance

Ensuring appropriate behavior in smart contracts

## Centralized Control

Monopoly in traditional finance

DeFi is decentralized (by definition!)

Forked away

Decentralization trade-offs

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

- It is common for a DAO to have some kind of governance token, which gives
an owner some percentage of the vote on future outcomes

## Lack of Interoperability

Traditional finance vs. DeFi

- Traditional financial (TradFi) products are difficult to integrate with each
other, generally requiring at minimum a wire transfer, but in many cases
cannot be recombined.
- The possibilities for DeFi are substantial and new innovations continue to
grow at a non-linear rate.
- This growth is fueled by the ease of composability of DeFi products
