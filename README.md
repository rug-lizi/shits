shits that flows everywhere, free and various

## Initiatives

- to use markdown more often
- to build up the notes of the courses I take, faithfuly

## Style

- every note behaves as a creature in the sea, it can swim anywhere, dig a hole and hide, group with alikes, or act on his own.
- notes can reproduce notes that behave the same way
- notes cannot destroy the environment, which is the water or other notes in large amount.
